This project analyzes employee satisfaction and performance data to help HR teams identify 
disengaged employees and improve hiring decisions.
Using a Random Forest model trained on 25+ features, 
it predicts low satisfaction with 72% accuracy and flags high-risk cases. 
Key insights include department-wise trends and
top drivers like OverTime and EnvironmentSatisfaction. 
The project is structured into modular notebooks and
meets all IABAC certification requirements.

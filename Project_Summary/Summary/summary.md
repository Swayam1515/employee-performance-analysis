# 📊 Employee Performance Analysis — IABAC Certified Data Scientist Project

## 🎯 Objective
To analyze employee satisfaction and performance data, build a predictive model for low satisfaction, and generate actionable HR insights to improve workforce engagement and hiring decisions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
HR teams struggle to identify employees at risk of low satisfaction, which can lead to attrition and reduced productivity. This project builds a data-driven solution to:
- Understand department-wise performance trends
- Identify key drivers of low satisfaction
- Predict employee satisfaction using a trained model
- Recommend interventions to improve performance
